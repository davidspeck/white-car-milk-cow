I wrote a blog post about the balance of Super Smash Brothers. Part of what made that post so successful is some cool interactive charts. This repo is everything necessary to make those charts happen.

/src - Juicy folder with all the JavaScript code to make the magic happen
/lib - External dependencies. Some folk link externally, but I prefer for all dependencies to be includes.
/demo - Some basic HTML files that actually render the charts. Should "just work" if you download repository as a zip and open. That's the goal at least!
